            Yes, you know about climate change, 
            but how can you slow it down? We started
             this, we end this. Below is a list of things 
             YOU can do to help climate change.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Reducing your water can help to reduce carbon pollution. How? It takes energy to power your water. Yes, that tap you accidentally left on for a long time not only makes your floor soaking, but it also uses up so much energy. You can help save water by turning the tap off when not needed and taking quick showers.</p>

                <p>Do you know, that <b id="bold">28.8</b> of U.S greenhouse gas emissions are 
                 caused by transportation? Cars and buses produce so many emissions,
                 and we don't need all that pollution in the air. Instead, what YOU 
                 can do, is carpool when you can with your friends. You can also take
                 walkes instead of rides, or just bike to your destination. This way,
                 you get stronger, AND you get more fresh air, that hopefully stays
                 clean fresh because you chose to go green.   </p>

                           <p>
                            Unplugging is important. Why? Because if you have a device that's fully charged and still plugged into a charger, that's nothing but wasting energy. It's all charged, it can't take any more. What can YOU do to save all this energy? Yes. You can only plugin devices if they need to be charged, and remove them when done. You can also skip plugging in devices that you use less often, or you rarely use. This was, not only are you saving your electricity bills, but you are also saving our planet. Good job!

                           <p>When you buy food, make sure you eat it, for three reasons. Reason number 1, it is environmentally friendly. It takes a lot of energy to grow, process, package and ship all of your food. Reason number two, 40% of that shipped food ends up in the landfill. What a waste of energy! Reason number 3, a lot of people don't have enough money to feed themselves or their family... and to think 40% of that food ends up in the landfill! Only buy what you need, and please don't waste food.  </p>
